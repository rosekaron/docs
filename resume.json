I offer a total of over 15 years of experience in software development in the fields of online gaming and e-learning. I've worked for both start ups and large companies in three different countries (Philippines, Singapore and China). My unique background and experience as well as my can-do attitude allows me to easily integrate into any team. I am naturally curious which helps me to effortlessly learn new systems. I am cheerful, energetic and warm-- traits that my mentors and peers said are welcomend in the logical world of engineering.

      "summary": "EF is one of the largest educational institions in the world with over 42,000 employees distributed in 112 different countries. Since 1988, EF has been partnering with the Olympics committee in providing language training for chosen host countries. It also partners with the Clinton foundation in awarding the Hult Prize, a global competition for young social entrepreneurs, typically themed after finding solutions to global problems. At EF, I was lucky with the unique opportunity to hand-pick my projects so during my three and a half years tenure, I was able to help five different teams to success.",

        "Led a team of engineers in launching the latest version of EF's language learning software to millions of users all over the world, including 1 million staff and volunteers in the current Rio 2016 olympics.",
        "Led a team of engineers in creating a proof of concept for using AEM as a CMS platform for delivering dymanic content on the web and on mobile. AEM is commonly used for delivering static content only but we extend the use of an existing product resulting in cost savings and reusing knowledge in existing systems.",
        "Initiated and led a team of engineers into building monitoring tools using the ELK (elastic search, logstash and kibana) stack. Joining EF Kids and Teens, A lot of reported bugs related to external systems (CDN provider, our own CDN, physical school infra structure to name a few) that lacked monitoring. To adress this, we invested on tools that helped our product support staff act proactively and monitor the health of our physical schools.",
        "Collaboated with the SVP of Product and VP of User Experience into starting a bi-monthly Product Council. Prior to setting up the council, our stakeholders wanted to address transparency in ongoing projects. The challenge was to ensure that the meeting stayed efficient as its participants are among the top decision makers of the company. It was also necessary that the decisions stayed true to our academic and product commitments. What I started set the stage for a better working relationship between us and our stakeholders and the program is still being actively adopted across the company today.",
        "Led the adoption of OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) as a goal setting tool for EF Labs/ EF's Kids and Teens On top of championing the adoption of OKRs, I also convinced upper management about the importance of having a quarterly all hands meeting where we review and celebrate the scores of our OKRs. This resulted to better alignment and transparency within the organization. Upper management had the ambition of company-wide implemnentation but the only reference material we had was a video of Rick Klau explaining how it worked for Google. As then Head of PMO for EF, I compiled reference training material from Google and Quora and every article I could find on the internet about OKRs. I'd then hold 1 on 1 Q&A sessions with the SVP of Product so as I can form a base FAQ of our version of OKRs. Each time a staff would raise questions not covered in the FAQ, I'd raise it to upper management and get an answer included in a new revision. I also highlighted the importance of a having a quarterly all hands meeting where we celebrate our OKR scores as a company."

While Rose has got a very good insight of all the potential risks in the very beginning, She helped to clarify every grey areas with both product owners and technical leads, and made everything clear enough for development. Documents were well written, coordinates were well communicated, and issues were well tracked. And finally, under big pressure, we managed to delivered the project ahead of time.  Rose is smart, and optimistic, she is a person that can influence every people around in a positive way to a positive direction, it is a lot of fun working with her, no matter how hard the things we are working on."

She will always keep you posted, focusing on finishing the task with high performance, and if things get really hard she can make it up with a smile upon her face and totally willing to start it all over again if needed.   She is an \"avatar\" for positivity, and if you need to find a softer (but still pretty effective) way to achieve a common goal, you should involve Rose. Our company has many good people, but Rose is one of the memorable ones. Everyone that works with me (in Brazil's office) share the same feelings, although we live oceans away from her."
