    "summary": "Nothing makes me happier than to see a business idea come to life. For more than 15 years, I've worked in four different countries (Philippines, Singapore, China, Sweden), gathering business requirements and transforming them to powerful systems/ solutions in complex industries (gaming, e-learning, social networking and travel education).   I am empathetic and I love people, a combination that helps me bridge business and technology easily. I'm an advocate of the use of agile methodologies which ensures that all my projects, big and small reach a demo-able state, open to feedback and are meeting business needs. I currently work as a freelance Business Analyst/ Product Manager for SchoolApply, a platform that connects and recruits students to international education institutions. At SchoolApply, I am responsible for the design and delivery of a data management platform that is being developed using a remote development team.  As a Technical Project Manager at EF Kids and Teens, I partnered with Product and Content development and led a team of engineers in the digital transformation of one of the key products of the company.   As Product Manager at MyCube - a privacy focused social exchange, I was responsible for authoring the initial specifications for the web experience as well as specifying and designing the mobile experience.   As a Business Systems Analyst for Strategem Technologies - an online gaming outfit, I was part of a team responsible for translating high level business requirements into detailed specifications. During my tenure, I had the privilege of being involved in building a robust marketing back office tool and promoter program that was used for managing all of Mansion.com's campaigns.",

While Rose has got a very good insight of all the potential risks in the very beginning, She helped to clarify every grey areas with both product owners and technical leads, and made everything clear enough for development. Documents were well written, coordinates were well communicated, and issues were well tracked. And finally, under big pressure, we managed to delivered the project ahead of time.

She is an \"avatar\" for positivity, and if you need to find a softer (but still pretty effective) way to achieve a common goal, you should involve Rose. Our company has many good people, but Rose is one of the memorable ones. Everyone that works with me (in Brazil's office) share the same feelings, although we live oceans away from her."
