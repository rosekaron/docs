While Rose has got a very good insight of all the potential risks in the very beginning, She helped to clarify every grey areas with both product owners and technical leads, and made everything clear enough for development. Documents were well written, coordinates were well communicated, and issues were well tracked. And finally, under big pressure, we managed to delivered the project ahead of time.  Rose is smart, and optimistic, she is a person that can influence every people around in a positive way to a positive direction, it is a lot of fun working with her, no matter how hard the things we are working on."

She will always keep you posted, focusing on finishing the task with high performance, and if things get really hard she can make it up with a smile upon her face and totally willing to start it all over again if needed.   She is an \"avatar\" for positivity, and if you need to find a softer (but still pretty effective) way to achieve a common goal, you should involve Rose. Our company has many good people, but Rose is one of the memorable ones. Everyone that works with me (in Brazil's office) share the same feelings, although we live oceans away from her."
